            <h1>What’s a VPN Anyway?</h1>
            <p>A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, is like a secure tunnel  for your internet traffic. <br>  It encrypts your connection  and hides your IP address, making your online actions <br> nearly impossible to trace. It's the best way to keep hackers, snoopers, and even  <br> your internet service provider from peeking at what you're up to online.</p>
